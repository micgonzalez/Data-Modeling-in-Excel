# Data Modeling with a Pivot Table in Excel

# Introduction
This repository is based on making a data model and then creating a pivot table in the Excel program. I was tasked to created one for a meeting.

# Abstract
I was tasked to make a data model based on administration data that had many features. I was also tasked in creating a pivot table from that data that included a few features.


# Summary of Skills
I used the windows environment with the Excel program to complete this project.

# Findings
I was take a back on the step taken to transform the data into a working model. The model allowed to look for useful relationships between the features. 

# Challenges
There wasn't any major challenges for me. In Excel, there are many useful functions that allow to transform the worksheet into a useful data model and pivot table.

# Conclusion
The Excel program has many more useful functions that I haven't used. Using the data modeling function allowed for a streamlined process that also cuts down on time. This allowed to me bring insights to the meeting.
